        "- Testing whether a coin is fair (\\( p = 0.5 \\)) by flipping it 100 times and observing the number of heads. If the number of heads is unusually high or low, the binomial distribution can help calculate the probability of such an outcome under the null hypothesis.\n",

        "- **Business**: A company might use the binomial distribution to estimate the likelihood of a certain number of customers responding to a marketing campaign, given a known response rate.\n",
        "- **Finance**: It can model the number of successful investments in a portfolio, where each investment has a probability of yielding a profit.\n",

        "For large \\( n \\), the binomial distribution can be approximated by other distributions to simplify calculations:\n",
        "- **Normal approximation**: When \\( n \\) is large and \\( p \\) is not too close to 0 or 1 (typically \\( n \\cdot p \\geq 5 \\) and \\( n \\cdot (1-p) \\geq 5 \\)), the binomial distribution is approximately normal with mean \\( n \\cdot p \\) and variance \\( n \\cdot p \\cdot (1-p) \\).\n",

        "The standard normal distribution is a cornerstone of probability and statistics due to its mathematical properties and wide applicability. Here’s why it is important:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Standardization of Normal Distributions**\n",
        "- The standard normal distribution serves as a universal reference for all normal distributions. By transforming any normal random variable \\(X\\) into \\(Z\\) using the z-score, probabilities can be computed using a single set of tables (z-tables) or software, simplifying calculations.\n",
        "- This standardization allows comparisons across different datasets with different means and variances.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**\n",
        "- The CLT states that the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables, regardless of their original distribution, tends to follow a normal distribution. When standardized, these sums or averages approximate the standard normal distribution.\n",
        "- This makes the standard normal distribution critical for analyzing sample means, proportions, and other statistics in large samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Statistical Inference**\n",
        "- **Hypothesis Testing**: The standard normal distribution is used in z-tests to determine whether observed data significantly deviates from a null hypothesis.

        "#### 1. **Justifies the Use of Normal Distribution**\n",
        "- The CLT explains why the normal distribution is so prevalent in statistics. Since sample means (or sums) tend to be normally distributed for large \\(n\\), many statistical methods rely on the normal distribution for analysis, even when the underlying data is not normally distributed.\n",

        "\n",
        "Confidence intervals are a cornerstone of statistical inference, providing a way to quantify uncertainty and make informed decisions based on sample data. Their significance lies in the following key aspects:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Estimating Population Parameters**\n",
        "- Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for an unknown population parameter (e.g., mean, proportion, regression coefficient) rather than a single point estimate. This accounts for sampling variability and gives a more complete picture of the parameter’s likely value.\n",
        "- For example, in a survey, if 60% of a sample supports a policy with a 95% CI of [55%, 65%], we estimate the true population proportion is likely between 55% and 65%.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Quantifying Uncertainty**\n",
        "- CIs explicitly show the uncertainty associated with sample-based estimates. A wider interval indicates greater uncertainty (e.g., due to a small sample size or high variability), while a narrower interval suggests more precision.\n",
        "- This helps researchers and decision-makers understand the reliability of their estimates. For instance, a wide CI for a medical treatment effect might indicate the need for a larger sample to achieve more precise results.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Supporting Decision-Making**\n",
        "- Confidence intervals are used in fields like medicine, business, and policy to guide decisions. For example:\n",
        "  - **Medicine**: A CI for the difference in effectiveness between two treatments helps determine if one is significantly better.\n",
        "  - **Business**: A CI for average customer spending informs budgeting or marketing strategies.\n",
        "  - **Policy**: A CI for the unemployment rate helps policymakers assess economic conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Connection to Hypothesis Testing**\n",
        "- Confidence intervals are closely related to hypothesis tests. If a hypothesized parameter value (e.g., a null hypothesis mean) falls outside the CI, it suggests the null hypothesis can be rejected at the corresponding significance level.\n",
        "  - For example, a 95% CI for a mean that does not include 0 indicates a statistically significant difference from 0 at the 5% significance level.\n",
        "- CIs provide more information than p-values in hypothesis testing because they show the range of plausible values and the magnitude of the effect, not just whether the result is significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Facilitating Comparisons**\n",
        "- Confidence intervals allow comparisons between groups or conditions. If the CIs for two groups’ means do not overlap, it suggests a statistically significant difference. If they overlap slightly, further analysis may be needed.\n",
        "- For example, if the 95% CI for the average test scores of two teaching methods are [75, 80] and [82, 88], the non-overlapping intervals suggest a significant difference in effectiveness.\n",

        "- The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) ensures that, for large samples, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal, enabling the construction of CIs using the standard normal or t-distribution. This makes CIs applicable even when the population distribution is non-normal, as long as the sample size is sufficiently large.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 7. **Practical Interpretation**\n",
        "- The confidence level (e.g., 95%) indicates the long-run proportion of intervals that would contain the true parameter if the sampling process were repeated infinitely. This helps communicate the reliability of the estimate to non-technical audiences.\n",
        "- For example, a 95% CI for a drug’s effectiveness means that if we repeated the study many times, 95% of the resulting intervals would contain the true effectiveness.\n",

        "- **Science**: CIs are used to estimate parameters like reaction times, physical constants, or biological measurements, accounting for experimental variability.\n",

        "  - **Engineering**: Expected value helps estimate average system performance, such as the expected time to failure of a machine.\n",
        "  - **Economics**: Expected utility theory uses expected value to model decision-making under uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Connection to the Law of Large Numbers**\n",
        "- The **Law of Large Numbers** states that as the number of trials \\(n\\) increases, the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) converges to the expected value \\(E[X]\\). This justifies the interpretation of expected value as the long-run average and supports its use in statistical inference.\n",
        "- For example, if you roll a die many times, the average of the outcomes will approach 3.5, the expected value.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 6. **Applications in Hypothesis Testing and Estimation**\n",
        "- Expected value is critical in statistical inference. For instance, in hypothesis testing, the expected value of a test statistic under the null hypothesis is used to determine whether observed data is consistent with the hypothesis.\n",
        "- In estimation, the expected value of an estimator (e.g., sample mean) is evaluated to check for **unbiasedness** (i.e., \\(E[\\hat{\\theta}] = \\theta\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is the true parameter).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example with a Binomial Distribution\n",
        "Consider a binomial random variable \\(X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n=5, p=0.3)\\), representing the number of successes in 5 trials with a 30% success probability. The expected value is:\n",
        "\\[\n",
        "E[X] = n \\cdot p = 5 \\cdot 0.3 = 1.5\n",
        "\\]\n",
        "This means, on average, you expect 1.5 successes in 5 trials."

        "# daily_sales = [220, 245, 210, 265, 230, 250, 260, 275, 240, 255,235, 260, 245, 250, 225, 270, 265, 255, 250, 260]\n",

        "### Applying the Central Limit Theorem to Estimate Average Sales with a 95% Confidence Interval\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that for a sufficiently large sample size, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal, regardless of the population distribution, provided the samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with finite mean and variance. This allows us to estimate the population mean (average daily sales) and construct a confidence interval using the sample mean and standard error.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Steps to Apply the CLT:\n",
        "1. **Verify Conditions for CLT**:\n",
        "   - **Sample Size**: The given data has 20 daily sales values. While \\( n = 20 \\) is relatively small, the CLT can still apply if the population distribution is not extremely skewed. For practical purposes, \\( n \\geq 30 \\) is ideal, but \\( n = 20 \\) is often sufficient for approximate normality unless the data is highly non-normal.\n",
        "   - **Independence**: Assume the daily sales are independent (e.g., one day’s sales do not influence the next day’s sales).\n",
        "   - **Identical Distribution**: Assume the sales data comes from the same underlying population distribution (e.g., similar market conditions over the 2 years).\n",
        "   - **Finite Mean and Variance**: Sales data typically have finite mean and variance, which we can verify by computing the sample mean and standard deviation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Calculate Sample Statistics**:\n",
        "   - Compute the **sample mean** (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) as an estimate of the population mean (\\(\\mu\\)).\n",
        "   - Compute the **sample standard deviation** (\\(s\\)) to estimate the population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)).\n",
        "   - The **standard error** (SE) of the sample mean is \\( \\text{SE} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\), which measures the variability of the sample mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Construct the 95% Confidence Interval**:\n",
        "   - For a 95% confidence interval, use the standard normal distribution (z-distribution) if the sample size is large or the population is approximately normal. For smaller samples (\\( n < 30 \\)), the t-distribution is more appropriate, especially if the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
        "   - Since \\( n = 20 \\) is moderate and \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown, we’ll use the t-distribution with \\( n-1 = 19 \\) degrees of freedom. The critical value \\( t_{\\alpha/2} \\) for a 95% confidence level is approximately 2.093 (from t-tables or statistical software).\n",
        "   - The confidence interval is:\n",
        "     \\[\n",
        "     \\bar{x} \\pm t_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\n",
        "     \\]\n",
        "     where \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean, \\(s\\) is the sample standard deviation, and \\( n \\) is the sample size.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Interpret the Confidence Interval**:\n",
        "   - The resulting interval estimates the range within which the true population mean (average daily sales over the 2 years) lies with 95% confidence. This means that if we repeated the sampling process many times, 95% of the confidence intervals would contain the true mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Check for Normality**:\n",
        "   - To ensure the CLT applies, we can visually inspect the data (e.g., via a histogram or Q-Q plot) to check if the sample distribution is not extremely skewed. For \\( n = 20 \\), slight deviations from normality are acceptable, as the t-distribution accounts for additional uncertainty in small samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Assumptions and Considerations:\n",
        "- The data provided (20 values) is a sample from 2 years of daily sales. We assume these values are representative and randomly sampled from the population of daily sales.\n",
        "- If the sales data is highly skewed or contains outliers, the CLT’s approximation may be less reliable for \\( n = 20 \\), and alternative methods (e.g., bootstrapping) might be considered. However, for this analysis, we’ll proceed with the t-distribution due to the moderate sample size and unknown population variance.\n",
